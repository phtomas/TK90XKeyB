Gerbers files to produce TK90X keyboard boards to substitute membranes.
Remember to produce then in 0.6mm thin boards to that fit perfectly with rubber keys and faceplate 'sandwich'.
you can use original acetate and upper membrane to make contact for the keys, since at least key contact points
are working. Or you can coat that points with some conduct ink or even stick some conduct material in that.
